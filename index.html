<h2>Dizytle</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>Save the data!!</strong> </li>
<li></li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Using gravity, get the data (the yellow boxes) to the goal at the bottom. 
 Remember to watch out for yourself (the white ball) while your at it!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to feel frustration or determination.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Arcade puzzle game!
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Use the arrow keys to change gravity's direction. Use the WAD keys to move
yourself to safety.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Tried to figure out how shift gravity (and did). Tried to figure out how to 
turn the camera or world view (couldn't figure it out).
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Gravity and computer inner-workings?
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You (in white) are a motherboard trying to save your data from the virus!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Oh no! A virus has attacked your home! You know you wont make it out alive,
but what about your data? You can try shifting it through the system to an external
hard-drive! But can you do it before the virus consumes you?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who like puzzle games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
A while. It may seem short at first, but trust me, it takes a while!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE! Make sure you (in white) are in a safe place before
shifting the gravity! 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
One of those 3D maze toys where you try to get the marble from one side to the other...?
